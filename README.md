# table
This is a repository for the possibility of a real life table made out of wood

With an svg that is compatible with the Shaper Origin (shapertools.com), we can make a table.

The shape needs to be flat.  You can add intricate designs and the tool will cut them.

Dustin has the tool and plenty of tape.
